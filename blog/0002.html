    <a class="terminal">Hi, and thanks for checking out my website (again). Today, I will talk about the PC I built for about Â£600 including the monitor, and I have affectionately named the PC Imperial. In this post, I will review it, talk about the specs and tell you how to buy it.</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a class="terminal">This is my review of it before I upgrade it in a months time, and in a couple of months or so with a new 24 Inch monitor as well as the current one, an additional 2TB HDD, another 8GB of RAM, a new and hopefully more comfortable gaming chair (I am currently sitting on a chair that would normally go at a dining table). I'll also get a Bluetooth USB dongle and sort out my horrible cable management when I take it all apart to install the new components (and I'll give it a dust down too). Also (totally unrelated) I may get a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ to tinker with. When I get the new upgrades and when I make another new review </a>
